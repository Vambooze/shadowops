# Calm-AI V3
## What is it?
Essentially Calm-AI V3 is a script that takes the old Calm-AI by NickThe0ne but improves it by adding a feature that lets you control the amount of AI around you as well all in a nice config file. This script is 100% standalone and requires minimal configuration. You can configure the AI density(amount of AI) in the `config.lua` and manage the AI relationships in the `relationships.dat` file. This script also allows for the disabling of AI dispatching as a whole.
